# zaio_javascript_challenge

# Desciption:

This is a simple challenge I got the Zaio boot camp. The requirements are simple, there are 3 blocks on the left representing different colors. When the user clicks on either of them, it changes the color of the big block on the right, and also displays the sum of the ASCII codes of the characters spelling that specific color representing each letter of the work.

# Reflection:

During this little challenge learned about:
-ASCII values, and
-Using javascript to manipulate the dom.
